- why, what terraform?
- terraform plan, apply and destroy 
- how to make changes to existing config
- what is state file in terraform
- terraform variable ( used by var.variablename)
    - you can create a single file of variables (called variables.tf) in the same folder
    
 ----------

 - Output: outputs.tf is used to define and expose specific values (like instance IDs, IPs, or ARNs) from your Terraform configuration after apply, so they can be viewed or reused by other modules.
    - this comes as output when you do aws apply
