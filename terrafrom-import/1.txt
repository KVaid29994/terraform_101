📥 What Is terraform import?
- It associates an existing cloud resource (e.g., AWS EC2, S3, VPC) with a Terraform resource block in your configuration.

- It does not create or modify the resource — it simply tells Terraform:
“This thing already exists. Track it in state.”


🧪 Syntax

terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <resource_id>

🔍 Example: Import an AWS VPC

terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8

🧠 Key Notes
- You must define the resource block in your .tf files before importing.
- After import, run terraform plan to verify the config matches the actual resource.
- If your config differs from the real resource, Terraform will try to reconcile it — possibly triggering changes.
- Works with most providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
