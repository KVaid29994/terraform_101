🧱 What Is a Terraform Module?

A Terraform module is a collection of .tf and/or tf.json configuration files grouped together to manage a specific set of resources. Think of it as a reusable package of Terraform code that encapsulates infrastructure logic.


There are two types of modules:
- Root module: The main directory where Terraform is run. Every Terraform configuration has at least a root module.
- Child module: Any module called from another module using a module block.


🔁 Why Use Modules?
- Reusability: Define infrastructure patterns once and reuse them across environments or projects.
- Abstraction: Hide complexity behind a simple interface using input variables and outputs.
- Organization: Break large configurations into smaller, manageable components.
- Consistency: Enforce standards across teams and environments.
